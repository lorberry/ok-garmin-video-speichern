# ok-garmin-video-speichern

this program presses the F10 key as soon as you say “okay garmin, save video”. this is how you use it:

1. do pip install requierements bla bla

2 download model from https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models

3. in a recording program of your choice, e.g. OBS, set the replay hotkey for saving a video with the replay buffer to F10

4. start the python program and start the replay buffer, enjoy

### big thanks
